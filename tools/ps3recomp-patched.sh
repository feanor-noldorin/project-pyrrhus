# checked out with CRLF, and the patches' LF context then stops applying part-way through the series (patch 1041 was the
# first). The submodule's own .gitattributes come from upstream, so the check is here: count the files whose index copy is
# LF and whose working copy is CRLF, and stop before copying anything. Reads the index only (works with a read-only .git);
# no git or no index: no check.

ps3recomp-patched: $crlf file(s) in $SUB are checked out with Windows (CRLF) line endings but stored with LF,
so the patches would not apply. This is git's core.autocrlf (on by default in Git for Windows). Turn it off for
this repository and the submodule, then write the submodule's files out again (this discards any edits in it;
a plain checkout skips files git considers unchanged):
  git config core.autocrlf false
  git -C $SUB config core.autocrlf false
  git -C $SUB rm -r -q --cached . && git -C $SUB reset -q --hard
For a new clone: git -c core.autocrlf=false clone --recurse-submodules <url>, then the second line above.
